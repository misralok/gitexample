### Let's learn how to print "Hello World' in four different programming languages!

“Hello World” is a common introductory exercise new and old developers complete when they start a new language. The exercise allows you to write a simple program that displays a message, which in this case is “Hello World.” This lesson will not only teach you how to write “Hello World” in six programming languages, but we will also give you insight on the benefits for each language.

As you explore these four languages, it is helpful to consider what type of development you are interested in. There are no right answers on what type of language you should choose, but these are recommendations based on common practices.

If you are interested in creating simple websites, such as a portfolio site or fan site, I would recommend learning HTML and JavaScript.

If you are interested in creating web applications, such as online games or the next social media site, I would recommend learning HTML, JavaScript, and Ruby. Ruby paired with a web framework called Rails can help you build simple web applications.

If you are interested in data science I would recommend learning Python as it has a lot of premade tools for working with data.
